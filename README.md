SBBClient
=========

Being a quick proof-of-concept hack using AFNetworking 2.0 and Mantle.

Pulls SBB data from transport.opendata.ch to grab stations in and around ZÃ¼rich, then displays departure data for a chosen location.
Uses AFNetworking2.0 as the comms library and Mantel to parse the JSON into objects.
